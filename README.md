# Yt Timer
Are you addicted to watching YouTube? I am. That's why I built this chrome extension which shows me how much time I am spending on YouTube. It also shows weekly Data with average time spent. This extension works on all chromium based web browsers (Eg. Brave, Google Chrome)
## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open your browser and on address bar paste this link `chrome://extensions/` (works on both Google Chrome and Brave)
3. In the top right corner, turn on 'Developer Mode`, this will activate three buttons on the left.
4. Click `Load Packed`, and select the folder where you cloned the repository.
5. Accept the permissions required, voila Yt Timer is activated.
